# Scraping-and-NLP-Pipeline
## Overview
This project aims to demonstrate techniques for web scraping Arabic web sources, storing the data in a MongoDB NoSQL database, and applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, parts of speech tagging, and named entity recognition (NER) to the scraped Arabic text.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scrapy
- Beautiful Soup
- MongoDB
- NLTK
- spaCy
## Project Structure
- scraping/: Contains the web scraping scripts using Scrapy and Beautiful Soup.
- database/: Includes scripts for storing the scraped data in MongoDB.
- nlp/: Houses the NLP pipeline scripts, including text cleaning, tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, parts of speech tagging, and NER.
## Web Scraping
- We utilized Scrapy and Beautiful Soup libraries to scrape data from various Arabic web sources. The scripts navigate HTML structures, extract relevant information, and handle Arabic text encoding challenges.

## Data Storage
- Scraped data is stored in a MongoDB database. Scripts in the database/ directory facilitate efficient storage and retrieval of the raw data.

## NLP Pipeline
- The NLP pipeline includes the following steps:

Text cleaning: Removing noise and unwanted characters.
Tokenization: Breaking text into words or sentences.
Stop word removal: Eliminating common words that carry little meaning.
Discretization: Transforming continuous data into discrete intervals.
Normalization: Standardizing text representations.
## Stemming and Lemmatization
We implemented stemming and lemmatization techniques to normalize Arabic words. Comparisons between the two mechanisms were made to understand their effects on downstream NLP tasks.

## Parts of Speech Tagging
Parts of speech tagging was performed using both rule-based . Libraries like NLTK and spaCy were employed for this purpose.

## Named Entity Recognition (NER)
NER methods were applied to identify and classify entities such as names of people, organizations, and locations in Arabic text. Pre-trained models and custom models were used for this task.

## Challenges and Learnings
- Limited availability of resources for Arabic language processing posed challenges.
- Overcoming encoding issues and handling Arabic text presented learning opportunities.
- Insights were gained into effective techniques for working with Arabic text data.
## Conclusion
This project showcased the application of web scraping, NLP, and NER techniques to Arabic text data. By addressing challenges and leveraging various tools and libraries, valuable insights were gained into Arabic language processing.

## Future Work
- Explore more advanced NLP techniques tailored for Arabic text.
- Incorporate additional Arabic language resources and datasets.
- Enhance the efficiency and accuracy of NLP models through further experimentation and fine-tuning.
