# Scraping-and-NLP-Pipeline
Introduction: They provided an overview of the project, highlighting the objectives and the technologies used.

Web Scraping: They described the process of scraping Arabic web sources using libraries like Scrapy and Beautiful Soup, explaining how they extracted relevant data and handled Arabic text encoding issues.

Data Storage: They explained how they stored the scraped data in a MongoDB NoSQL database, enabling efficient retrieval and manipulation.

NLP Pipeline: They outlined the steps involved in the NLP pipeline for Arabic text, including text cleaning, tokenization, stop word removal, discretization, and normalization.

Stemming and Lemmatization: They discussed the application of stemming and lemmatization techniques to normalize Arabic words, comparing the two mechanisms and their impact on downstream NLP tasks.

Parts of Speech Tagging: They explained how they implemented parts of speech tagging using both rule-based and machine learning-based approaches, using libraries like NLTK and spaCy.

Named Entity Recognition (NER): They described the implementation of NER methods to identify and classify entities in Arabic text, leveraging pre-trained models or building custom models.

Challenges and Learnings: They reflected on the challenges encountered during the project, particularly regarding the limited availability of resources for Arabic language processing. They discussed how they addressed these challenges and the insights gained from overcoming them.

Conclusion: They summarized the key findings and takeaways from the lab, emphasizing the importance of effective techniques for working with Arabic text data in web scraping, NLP, and NER tasks.

Future Work: They suggested potential areas for future improvement or expansion of the project, such as exploring more advanced NLP techniques or incorporating additional Arabic language resources.
